I'm Milia, 28, from Freiburg, Germany. 
Back at coding, but feel like a newby again cause it's been some time. Trying myself in a Web-Dev Course. 
I used to write some automatisation-stuff in Powershell and more fun things in Python.  
As much as I love spending time on my computer, I also love drawing flowers, tattooing the brave and all kinds of DIY-things.  
I got the Handicraft ADD Superpowers, which I love to set free in my Art Studio.
